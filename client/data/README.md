# Client data (runtime)

- **api_key** – Created when you pair the Lua client with your account (dashboard). Not in git or Local History. If missing, open the dashboard → Devices → pair again with the 6-digit code shown on the client.
- **code**, **device_name**, **device_history.json**, etc. – Also written by the app when pairing or syncing.
